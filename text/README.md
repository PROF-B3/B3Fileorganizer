# B3FileOrganizer v2.1 - The Future of File Organization

> **"Die Zukunft der Dateiorganisation, heute verf√ºgbar"**  
> *Ein System, das aus dem Jahr 2073 zur√ºck in die Gegenwart √ºbertragen wurde*

---

## üöÄ Quick Start (GUI First)

### 1. **Install Requirements**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. **(Optional) Add Retro B3 Icon**
- Place a file named `b3_icon.ico` (preferred, 32x32) or `b3_icon.png` in your project directory for a retro window icon in the GUI.

### 3. **Start the GUI**
```bash
python gui_launcher.py
```
- The GUI is now the default and recommended way to use B3FileOrganizer.
- On first run, onboarding/setup is handled directly in the GUI.
- The CLI is still available via `python run_organize.py` if needed.

---

## üñ•Ô∏è GUI Overview

- **Three Panels:**
  - **Left:** Agent Collaboration Terminal
  - **Center:** Main User Terminal (AI Conversation)
  - **Right:** System Control/Status Terminal
- **Retro Look:** Black background, green text, 80s computer font, and (optionally) a B3 icon in the window bar.
- **Hint Button:** Top left, shows usage instructions and panel commands.
- **Tab Key:** Cycles only between the three input boxes (not buttons).

### **Panel Commands**
- Type these in any panel's input box:
  - `/export` ‚Äî Export panel content to a `.txt` file
  - `/clear` ‚Äî Clear panel content
- Most other commands can be written in natural language; the AI will interpret and act (once backend is connected).

---

## üÜï What's New in v2.1.0
- GUI-first workflow with retro terminal look
- B3 icon support for window bar (add `b3_icon.ico` or `b3_icon.png`)
- Export and clear via panel commands (`/export`, `/clear`)
- Tab navigation cycles only between input boxes
- Onboarding and first-run setup now in the GUI
- CLI and all advanced features still available

---

## üÜò Need Help?
- Click the **Hint** button in the GUI for quick usage instructions and panel commands.
- See the rest of this README for advanced features, CLI usage, and troubleshooting.

## ÔøΩÔøΩ The Story of Prof. B3

**The Year 2073:** In a world where AI systems are as ubiquitous as smartphones today, Professor B3 (a brilliant but somewhat eccentric cultural scientist) works at the University of Temporal Transfer. His specialty: adapting future technologies for past times.

One night, while working on his latest project - a fully automated, self-learning file organization system with Greek AI agents - something unexpected happens. A temporal portal opens in his laboratory, and through a fortunate coincidence, the fundamental principles and mechanisms of his system are transferred to the past.

**The Year 2025:** You sit in front of your computer reading these lines. What Prof. B3 didn't know: The system he developed for 2073 was so brilliantly conceived that it also works with the modest AI models of 2025. Instead of highly developed quantum AI agents, it uses local Ollama models. Instead of a holographic user interface, there's a simple command line. But the fundamental principles - the Greek agents (Œë, Œí, Œì, Œî), the Zettelkasten method, the multi-agent coordination - all work even today.

**How does the system work?** Quite simply: It's like a team of four specialized assistants working together to organize your files. Alpha (Œë) is the chief organizer, Beta (Œí) analyzes content, Gamma (Œì) manages the knowledge system, and Delta (Œî) coordinates everything. They communicate with each other, learn from their interactions, and get better over time.

- **Zettelkasten Knowledge System**: Luhmann's method for organizing knowledge
- **Multi-Agent Orchestration**: Coordinated AI workflows
- **Wikipedia Integration**: Knowledge extraction and processing
- **File System Operations**: Intelligent file organization

### Key Features:
- **Intelligent Categorization**: Understands what your files contain
- **Automatic Folder Structure**: Creates logical folders based on content
- **Zettelkasten Integration**: Organizes knowledge using the proven Zettelkasten method
- **Learning Capability**: Gets better with each use
- **Wikipedia Processing**: Extracts structured knowledge from Wikipedia dumps

## üÜì Knowledge, Copyright, and the Future

*"O copyright e d'o pateterno"* - "Copyright belongs to the ancestors" as we say in 2073. In our time, the concept of restricting knowledge seems as archaic as feudalism. Knowledge flows freely, shared across timelines and dimensions. The very idea of "owning" information would be laughable to Prof. B3 and his colleagues.

This system represents a bridge between two worlds: the restrictive knowledge economy of 2025 and the open knowledge networks of 2073. Prof. B3's work is shared freely, not because it's required by law, but because that's simply how knowledge works in the future.

### The GPLv3 License
This project uses the GNU General Public License v3.0 (GPLv3) as a temporal adaptation. In 2073, such licenses don't exist - knowledge is inherently free. But here in 2025, we need legal frameworks to protect the free flow of information.

**What GPLv3 means:**
- **Freedom to Use**: You can run this software for any purpose
- **Freedom to Study**: You can examine and understand how it works
- **Freedom to Modify**: You can change it to suit your needs
- **Freedom to Share**: You can distribute copies to help others
- **Copyleft Protection**: Any derivative works must also be open source

## üìö The X and B Partitions

### The Zettelkasten System (X/)
The heart of the knowledge organization is the **X partition** - a digital implementation of Niklas Luhmann's Zettelkasten method:

```
X/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 1/           # Main topics
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ 2/           # Further main topics  
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ A/            # Frequently used
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Z/            # Quotes and excerpts
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ _metadata/    # System metadata
```

### The B Partition (databases/)
The **B partition** contains all system databases and learning data:

```
databases/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ b3team.db           # Main system database
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ conversations.db    # AI conversation history
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ wikipedia/          # Processed Wikipedia data
```

**These partitions are crucial** - they contain your organized knowledge and system learning. Always backup these directories before major changes.

## üíæ Backup & Versioning Best Practices

### Quick Manual Backup
- To backup your main database or any file, use:
  ```powershell
  cp test.db test.db.bak
  ```
- For a full project backup, copy the entire folder:
  ```powershell
  cp -Recurse B3FileOrganizer B3FileOrganizer_backup
  ```

### Recommended Versioning for Development
- Use Git for version control: commit changes regularly.
- Tag stable releases:
  ```bash
  git tag v2.0.0
  git push --tags
  ```
- For manual snapshots, copy the project folder with a date/version suffix:
  ```powershell
  cp -Recurse B3FileOrganizer B3FileOrganizer_2024-06-21
  ```
- Always backup your database(s) before major changes or upgrades.
