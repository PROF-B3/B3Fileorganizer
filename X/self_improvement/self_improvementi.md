## Kurz-Zusammenfassung
{
  "original_analysis": {
    "issues": [
      "The 'requests' module is imported every time the function is called, which can impact performance. It would be better to import it at the top level of the script.",
      "The error messages do not provide enough context for debugging, consider including more information about the city and error."
    ],
    "improvements": [
      "Add type annotation for function parameters and return value",
      "Consider using a dedicated error handling library for better error handling and logging",
      "Use a specific exception for non-200 status codes, such as requests.exceptions.HTTPError"
